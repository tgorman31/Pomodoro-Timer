# Pomodoro-Timer
A TUI based pomodoro timer written in Go with Bubbletea 

## Ideas
- User can set work time and break time via TUI
- The time remaining is shown as a loading bar
- The tui creates a new terminal window
- CLI flags on launch can be used to set the time
- Tracks pomodoros completed gives larger break after specified number of pomodoros
- Alternate mode where a timer counts up and gives you a break based on length of time worked
- Has tasks that the user can enter to track what they are working on each pomodoro
- Attempt Test Driven Development
- Windows notification system

## How I plan on working on this Project
My goal is to simulate a professional work environment and learn stuff along the way
  - I plan to manage tasks on a Kanban board
  - I plan to use feature branches and Pull Requests
